# Mintbean's PhaserJS Template
A test

## !Work in progress!

This is currently being developed. Please report any bugs in the issues tab!

## What we're trying to achieve

This starter template is meant to be a kickoff spot for a full-fledged PhaserJS game project.

- Simple template with asset pipeline to help you get started
- Ability to pivot into turn based games, action games, or any other kind of game.
- Good example code for various common game UX patterns.
- Livereload dev server using Parcel Bundler
- Support for `html`, `pug`, `md`, `js`, `jsx`, `ts`, `tsx`, `json`, `css`, `scss`, `postcss`, `less`, and various
  image filetypes, font files, and more. (See [Parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel)'s documentation)
- Yarn for faster package resolution

## Hackathon game design and notes


game design
  - add 1 dragon and 1 princesses to the game

  - move from 1 side of the screen to other

  - dodge the fireballs fired by the dragon

  - jump over them to avoid getting hit

  - either hit with a sword (or bump into the dragon if easier)

  - win criteria: run toward dragon and hit it (or bump into it, or maybe easier to run underneath)
  
  - lose criteria: get hit by dragon flames

look and feel
  - background: use a dungeon image
  - use a Knight

- deploy to codepen

- 4th session open class

- finish in 4 hours

- use assets

- use the code loop
    - update function?

- must have a win conditoin
